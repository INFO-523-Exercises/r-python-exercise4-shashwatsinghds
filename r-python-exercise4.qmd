# Loading Required Packages

```{r}
# Install necessary packages
if (!require(pacman))
  install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(tidymodels,
               tidyverse,
               ranger,
               randomForest,
               glmnet,
               gridExtra)

```

# Synthetic Data Generation

```{r}
# This block sets parameters for the analysis.
seed <- 1                   # Set the random seed for reproducibility
numInstances <- 200         # Define the total number of instances in the dataset

# Set seed
set.seed(seed)

# Generating data
X <- matrix(runif(numInstances), ncol=1)
y_true <- -3*X + 1 
y <- y_true + matrix(rnorm(numInstances), ncol=1)

```

- Here we have set seed and created Synthetic data randomly. We are using function which is relating y to x as y=3x+1. Also added gaussian noise.
